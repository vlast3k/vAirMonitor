<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The "vThings - CO2 Monitor R3" is the third and most advanced (till now) incarnation of my initial "vAir - CO2 Monitor" from 2014.&nbsp;Lot's of customer feedback and usecases have been collected and applied to both the hardware and software parts of the device. With all the available upgrades - this becomes one of the most customizable and advanced CO2 Monitors in the market as of 2016.</p>
